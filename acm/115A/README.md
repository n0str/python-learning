The idea is very simple.
1. We can prove that quantity of groups, equals to levels in the tree, is enough.
(Really, form first group from 0-level items, second group from 1-level e.t.c)
2. We can prove that quantity of groups can't be less than size of the biggest chain.
(Really, every person from biggest chain (it's size equals to quantity of levels) have to be in separate group from others in this chain.

Ok. Find size of the biggest chain - this is an answer.
